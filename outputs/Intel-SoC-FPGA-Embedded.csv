3,Is RSU(Remote System Upgrade) feature for PS/FPP available now for Cyclone V? What's the progress?,Someone asked the question long years ago. 
4,AT24C256C-SSHL is an Altera part and I wish to know how to remove/sanitize it's nonvolatile memory.,It is a IC CPLD of the Max II family 
5,Can you please tell me what additional testing may have been done on Intel PN EP2S30F484I4AB? I had been informed previously that the AB suffix was added when additional qualification was done.,
6,Does U-boot socfpga_v2019.04 really support LPDDR2?,"I cannot build cyclone V SPL using LPDDR2 with EDS 19.1. Does U-boot socfpga_v2019.04 really support LPDDR2?  Longer version: I have a custom cyclone V board with LPDDR2 HPS memory and so far I've been using SPL based on U-boot branch socfpga_v2013.01.01.  According to:   it seems that I have to upgrade U-boot to socfpga_v2019.04 when using EDS 19.1 but SPL does not compile when using LPDDR2 HPS memory due to missing defines. The missing ones all seem to be related to DDR3 (e.g. RW_MGR_MRS1).  I tried building new projects containing nothing but a HPS block:  When using default SDRAM (DDR3), SPL builds fine. The defines my build was missing all exist in hps_isw_handoff/*/sequencer_auto.h  When using Micron LPDDR2 SDRAM, SPL does not build due to missing defines. hps_isw_handoff/*/sequencer_auto.h does not contain the missing defines. See build log below.  Looking at code in u-boot-socfpga/drivers/ddr/altera I find no evidence of LPDDR2 support, e.g. LPDDRDIS is hardcoded to '1' in sequencer.c  So it seems that socfpga_v2019.04 does not support LPDDR2?  /Thomas  k7:~/altera/pl/c5_test_lpddr2/software/bootloader/u-boot-socfpga$ make -j8 CHK   include/config/uboot.release CHK   include/generated/timestamp_autogenerated.h UPD   include/generated/timestamp_autogenerated.h CHK   include/generated/version_autogenerated.h CHK   include/generated/generic-asm-offsets.h CHK   include/generated/asm-offsets.h HOSTCC tools/mkenvimage.o HOSTCC tools/fit_image.o HOSTCC tools/image-host.o HOSTCC tools/dumpimage.o HOSTCC tools/mkimage.o HOSTLD tools/mkenvimage HOSTLD tools/dumpimage HOSTLD tools/mkimage CC   arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_pll_config.o CC   common/main.o CC   cmd/version.o LD   arch/arm/mach-socfpga/built-in.o LD   common/built-in.o LD   cmd/built-in.o CC   lib/smbios.o CC   lib/display_options.o CC   lib/efi_loader/helloworld.o CC   lib/efi_loader/efi_reloc.o CC   lib/efi_loader/efi_freestanding.o LD   lib/efi_loader/helloworld_efi.so OBJCOPY lib/efi_loader/helloworld.efi LD   lib/built-in.o LD   u-boot OBJCOPY u-boot.srec OBJCOPY u-boot-nodtb.bin SYM   u-boot.sym CAT   u-boot-dtb.bin COPY  u-boot.bin MKIMAGE u-boot.img MKIMAGE u-boot-dtb.img CC   spl/common/spl/spl.o CC   spl/arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_pll_config.o CC   spl/arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_iocsr_config.o CC   spl/arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_pinmux_config.o CC   spl/arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.o CC   spl/lib/display_options.o arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:205:25: error: ‘RW_MGR_INIT_RESET_0_CKE_0’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_ACTIVATE_0_AND_1’? .init_reset_0_cke_0 = RW_MGR_INIT_RESET_0_CKE_0, ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_ACTIVATE_0_AND_1 arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:206:25: error: ‘RW_MGR_INIT_RESET_1_CKE_0’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_INIT_RESET_0_CKE_0’? .init_reset_1_cke_0 = RW_MGR_INIT_RESET_1_CKE_0, ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_INIT_RESET_0_CKE_0 arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:219:22: error: ‘RW_MGR_MRS0_DLL_RESET’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_SGLE_READ’? .mrs0_dll_reset  = RW_MGR_MRS0_DLL_RESET, ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_SGLE_READ arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:220:26: error: ‘RW_MGR_MRS0_DLL_RESET_MIRR’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_MRS0_DLL_RESET’? .mrs0_dll_reset_mirr = RW_MGR_MRS0_DLL_RESET_MIRR, ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_MRS0_DLL_RESET arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:221:17: error: ‘RW_MGR_MRS0_USER’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_MRS0_DLL_RESET’? .mrs0_user  = RW_MGR_MRS0_USER, ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_MRS0_DLL_RESET arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:222:22: error: ‘RW_MGR_MRS0_USER_MIRR’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_MRS0_USER’? .mrs0_user_mirr  = RW_MGR_MRS0_USER_MIRR, ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_MRS0_USER arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:223:13: error: ‘RW_MGR_MRS1’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_IDLE’? .mrs1  = RW_MGR_MRS1, ^~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_IDLE arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:224:17: error: ‘RW_MGR_MRS1_MIRR’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_MRS0_USER’? .mrs1_mirr  = RW_MGR_MRS1_MIRR, ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_MRS0_USER arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:225:13: error: ‘RW_MGR_MRS2’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_MRS1’? .mrs2  = RW_MGR_MRS2, ^~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_MRS1 arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:226:17: error: ‘RW_MGR_MRS2_MIRR’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_MRS1_MIRR’? .mrs2_mirr  = RW_MGR_MRS2_MIRR, ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_MRS1_MIRR arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:227:13: error: ‘RW_MGR_MRS3’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_MRS2’? .mrs3  = RW_MGR_MRS3, ^~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_MRS2 arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:228:17: error: ‘RW_MGR_MRS3_MIRR’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_MRS2_MIRR’? .mrs3_mirr  = RW_MGR_MRS3_MIRR, ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_MRS2_MIRR arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:234:15: error: ‘RW_MGR_RETURN’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_MRS3’? .rreturn  = RW_MGR_RETURN, ^~~~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_MRS3 arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.c:236:13: error: ‘RW_MGR_ZQCL’ undeclared here (not in a function); did you mean ‘RW_MGR_MRS3’? .zqcl  = RW_MGR_ZQCL, ^~~~~~~~~~~ RW_MGR_MRS3 scripts/Makefile.build:278: recipe for target 'spl/arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.o' failed make[2]: *** [spl/arch/arm/mach-socfpga/wrap_sdram_config.o] Error 1 scripts/Makefile.spl:398: recipe for target 'spl/arch/arm/mach-socfpga' failed make[1]: *** [spl/arch/arm/mach-socfpga] Error 2 make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

8,Relaying network packets from the HPS to the FPGA and vice versa on Cyclone V,"I am looking for design guidance in using the FPGA-to-HPS and HPS-to-FPGA bridges on a Cyclone V SoC FPGA. I am using the DE10-Standard board, which only has a Ethernet port connected to the HPS. I would like to relay the network packets to the FPGA for processing. What would be the best way to achieve that? I have read about the F2H and H2S bridges. Also the lightweight bridge, but which I suppose would be less appropriate for transferring packets since the lower throughput. But there is also the SDRAM, which seems to be another way to transfer data between the HPS and the FPGA. What would be more appropriate between the bridges and the SDRAM for transferring packets? On the HPS side, I was thinking about using DMA (I think mSGDMA) to reduce processor usage while transferring to the FPGA. Same could be done for the EMAC. Right now I am running Linux on the HPS, so I am not sure how to interface DMA. On the FPGA side, I would like to be able to use a streaming interface, like Avalon-ST to receive and send packets. Does Intel have such a wrapper since the bridges uses AXI? Thank you in advance for your time. "

17,How do I program the KAK (Key Authorization Key) in User Access Fuses (UAF).,"The background on this is the KAK, sometimes referred to Root Public Key, or the SHA256 of the public key, is used by the ROM bootloader to authenticate the 2nd stage bootloader. This is done by checking the signed 2nd stage boot loader with a Root Public Key stored in the User Access Fuses.  This should not be confused with the AES key used to decrypt the FPGA programming file, since it is completely different. The FPGA programming file decryption key can be programmed using a .ekp file, and documented in the Intel Arria 10 Soc Secure Boot User Guide. The KAK is also mentioned there in the Intel Arria 10 Soc Secure Boot User Guide, in the Root Public Key Authentication section, but how it is programmed in the FPGA is not detailed at all. Exactly why any details on this are missing is a mystery, but the details are completely missing.  I know how to generate the root public/private key pair: openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out root_key.pem  I know how to use the tools to sign the 2nd stage bootloader: alt-secure-boot sign --inputfile bootloader --keypair root_key.pem --rootkey-type fuse --outputfile bootloader.signed SHA256 digest of root public key: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The missing information is how to put this SHA256 digest into the UAF so the ROM bootloader can authenticate the 2nd stage on every startup. This is very specific so the answer should be very easy for the right person who knows. Can you help?

26,Problems about PCIe Link-Up of Stratix10,"Hi  I have a reset problems when combining the PLDA controller with Stratix10 PCIe Phy. Could you please check the following question?  Q1. I am using Stratix® 10 L- and H-Tile Transceiver PHY as a PCIe Phy. However, I found that this Phy needs to receive toggled serial signal from link-partner to finish its reset, which is different from the PIPE spec. And when I used an ""PLDA controller + Stratix10 Phy"" combination as both local and host, the reset of Phy never end as the controller won't transmit anything within reset period. So my question is, does this Phy have ever worked  successfully with controllers except for the Stratix10 PCIe controller?(i.e., Synopsys, Cadence, PLDA)  Q2. Actually, I am trying to combine PLDA controller and Stratix10 Phy.  And I stucked at the problem I mention at Q1. Do you know any work around about it?  Q3.

27,DMA-330 Won't Work on DE1-SoC [Baremetal],"I have the example project for the ADXL345 Accel that is on the Intel FTP site. I copied this and simply disabled the reads of the i2c0 RX Buffer.

I keep getting a status = -1 right at the API call alt_dma_periph_to_memory. I've replaced the data destination to an internal buffer then to the SDRAM, still won't work. I've rechecked all the settings made sure everything is out of reset, configured properly, the i2c works as intended, the program is correctly setup in on chip memory, data buffers fill up, and I cannot find out why it won't transfer.

28,Intel® Stratix® 10 L- and H-Tile Transceiver PHYの使い方について,①Stratix10で搭載されるPCIe PhyのPower-Onリセットに関する質問です。リセットシーケンスの中、Phyのrx_is_lockedtodata信号が立ち上がる条件として、rxが対向Phyからトグルした信号を受信したことだと見受けられます。この認識は正しいでしょうか？ ​ ②上記質問の回答がYesの場合の追加質問になります。 Stratix10のPCIe Phyのリセットの完了させるには、localよりもHost側のPhyが先にリセットを完了し、localへデータを送信しないといけません。Stratix10 PCIe Phy同士を繋いで使用する場合、localとhostがお互いに対して何かのデータを送信し合う仕組みが必要だと考えています。この認識は正しいでしょうか？ ※simulation上、そうしないとlocalもhostも対向からデータを受信できず、rx_is_lockedtodata信号が立ち上がらない状態になりました。

56,Reading memory mapped ADC values from HPS running Linux.,"Hi, I am running Ubuntu (kernel 4.5) provided by Terasic on my DE1-SoC board. From the demonstrations in the CD, I modified the hardware project and added ADC controller for DE series boards to the Qsys project like this:  The ADC is mapped to 0x0000_0000 to 0x0000_001F as a lightweight HPS to FPGA memory mapped slave. I generated the HDL, added ADC to the top-level verilog file like this: Compiled the project, converted the .sof file to .rbf file and replaced the existing .rbf file on the SD card with the one I generated (with the same name of course).  I started the DE1-SoC board and it booted normally. Next, I write the following program to read the values from ADC and print the values on the console: I map the ADC's base address to the virtual space, then I initiate an update of the 8 channels by writing to the UPDATE register, as described in the IP's manual: chapter 4, software programming model. I also isolate the 12 bits from 32-bit values. Then I read the values expecting to read the values of the ADC. (I slightly modified the code for better illustration of what I am doing (removed extra computations). I don't have the board with me to check if it compiles but you get the idea)..  Running this program, I only get 0's for all 8 channels. If I write any value to the UPDATE register, I read out the exact same value for the UPDATE register. I tried the auto-update register as well, getting the same values. Maybe my programming model is wrong. Can you give me any feedback?  "

The A10 HPS technical reference manual has the following notes against the ECCCTRL1 and ECCCTRL2 registers: ""This bit is used to set the initialize the memory and ecc to a known value""  This would suggest that explicit initialization of each DDR location is not required. Which ""bit"" is this referring to. There is no description of any initialization operation in either of these registers.​ "

63,Issue with eMMC accesses on Arria 10 SOC board?,"Hi,  I'm troubleshooting an issue on an Arria 10 SOC board running the Linux 4.20 kernel where we randomly see corruption reported on filesystems located on the eMMC. It doesn't happen frequently and is quite indeterminate but after many reboots, one or more of the filesystems that are mounted report errors (even on filesystems mounted as read-only). As part of tracking down the issue (and having not narrowed it down to the eMMC at the time), we tried other filesystem types (ext3->ext4 and ext3->cramfs) but the problem persisted.  An interesting data point is that previously we were using the Linux 3.10 kernel and did NOT see this issue. We went back and confirmed that the issue does not occur when using the 3.10 kernel by testing multiple boards over the course of 10 days. Given this and other debugging performed, the issue appears related to MMC driver changes in the 4.20 kernel (which appear to be substantial based on a cursory comparison of the two versions).  I'm currently performing an mmc controller register comparison and added CMD logging to the MMC kernel driver for the purposes of comparing the CMDs being sent during configuration.  Has anyone encountered this issue? Any suggestions on things to try?  If you have any questions for me, please feel free to ask.  Thanks, Ren "

Usage We have setup SDRAM with Alteras default timing parameters, e.g. (RFCab) = 75 to 130ns (Altera default=75, Micron 130ns) t(REFIab) = 15.6us (I increased it to 21us for testing) We can write/fill the SDRAM in about 1 sec. (two people have written different fill programs) Comments We see that our bus is halted with waitreq each 15.6us for max 770ns as expected. It varies if we change t(RFCab) or t(REFIab) as expected. The wierd thing is the 8us waitreq: it starts on the same 15.6us t(REFIab) interval as a normal, short refresh. For example, if I change t(REFIab) to 21.0us, the normal and wierd refresh each start on 21.0us or multiples. t(RFCab) changes the short refresh length but has no effect on the wierd refresh length Both ""refresh"" waitreq sequences start a random time after the fill begins, as expected since it is autonomous from when we start the fill program. 117.4ms is outside Microns spec: Micron requires refresh cycles to complete within each 32ms window. Since it is affected by changing t(REFIab) I presume it is caused by the Altera hard PHY SDRAM controller machine. My questions: What is this 117.4ms waitreq/refresh? How can we make it stop?  "

138,Problem in Linux booting on Custom Board of Cyclone V SX,"We have designed a custom board using Cyclone V SX SOC whose image we have attached with this request.  We have tested all the interfaces of our board and the board is working perfectly fine. We have been able to UBOOT using uSD Card even but we are unable to boot the Linux completely. It gets stuck at some point and we really need help as we have to dispatch the board to US in the coming month.  We have tried quite a bit but we are unable to boot complete Linux here. I have also attached the message we get during Linux boot with this email. We suspect that the device tree blob for the custom board is not correct but we are not completely sure.  Another issue that we are facing again is a software issue in case of RGMII as we have changed our RGMII chip from KSZ9021 to KSZ9031 and hence we are unable to PING using UBOOT. So what changes we can do in uBOOT to initiate PING? However, in case Linux gets booted, this problem can be solved from there.  Hence, I request forum to kindly help us in this so that our issue gets sorted out and we are able to proceed for production here. This once successful has considerable business opportunity for us as we have been working on this design for more than a year now. This has a potential of upto 500 boards finally for one application.  Will appreciate your reply in this regard.   "

144,MAX 10 RGMII interface - PLL input from non-dedicated clock pin,"Hello, I'm trying to create my own RGMII interface for the MAX 10 Development Kit.  Until now I was working with the Cyclone 10 LP Evaluation Kit, I sucesfully created an RGMII following this intel manual:   Now I wanted to adapt my project to this new MAX 10 board, but it is not working. So I guess that the RGMII PHY of this new board doesn't have the same skew configurations. I'm not able to find any information about that, in the Cyclone LP board I was able to find that for RX the delay is already implemented inside the physical chip, for Tx it's not so I used a PLL to displace the clock phase 90º.  As I don't really know where is the problem, my plan was to just try to center-align the Rx clock, and see if I start receiving something. But I can't connect a non-dedicated clock pin to the PLL, so I can't repeat the previously done for Tx.  Any ideas on how to do that? And also any idea about the skew configuration of that specific board? (It uses the Marvel 88E1111 chip).  Also the manual says that ""You can achieve this with a DLL and by assigning RX_CLK to a DQS pin or promoting RX_CLK to a global or regional net if you need a small clock latency.""

162,"How to convert Prime 18.1 ""Pro"" IP to ""Standard"" IP ?","I used Intel HLS (v18.1) to generate some IP, using the Prime ""Pro"" version.  Unfortunately, my top level design (where I would like to put the IP) is in ""standard"" version.  Is there a way to convert the 18.1 ""Pro"" version IP to ""Standard"" version IP so I can use it in my ""Standard"" design?  I am having problems using HLS in ""Standard"" version, due to the C++ library versions it requires, so it won't be easy for me to just regenerate the IP in HLS ""Standard"" version.  (I can't get that to work.)

163,​UEFI QSPI Boot Code loads mkimage header to FPGA and omits last 64 bytes of RBF image," I have created the UEFI boot code from the directions in the Intel Arria 10 SoC UEFI Boot Loader User Guide - UG-20100 | 2017.12.15. This boot code processes the Core RBF file with a prepended 64-byte mkimage header at 0x00820000. The LoadCoreRbfImageToRam function loads the RBF image from location 0x00820000 to DDR, and this is then loaded into the FPGA, using the RbfSize that was read from the mkimage header. Therefore the MkImage header is included in what is loaded into the FPGA and the 64-bytes at the end of the RBF file is not. Can anyone please confirm that this is not correct behaviour ? Strangely, the FPGA appears to operate OK when loaded with this mechanism using the golden reference design. However, it also operates OK when I change the behaviour to skip the mkimage header and only load the actual RBF file data. The NAND implementation appears to do the same. "
164,Is it possible to reach nearby CLBs optimally fast while using openCL?,"Hi, I am working on a research project to deepen my knowledge in parallell computing, and I have just scratched the surface of FPGA technology. To the best of my knowledge opencl is compatible with FPGAs. I would like to have my openCL kernels reach information locally which is stored in other CLBs nearby. The problem with this is I don't see any possibility to do that iteratively. Correct me if I'm wrong but the only option openCL gives to reaching local kernel-related information is through the local memory space. The only problem with that is that local memory access is restricted to user defined local workgroups. Local workgroups can be defined in such a way that the user is able to define sections in the board, whom have a common memory allocation space.  That kind of logic would not fit the purpose of my project, however in FPGA architecture there is such a thing as local addressing ( neighbouring CLBs, rows and lines ). A CLB is able to have input from a nearby CLB through the addressing system optimally, becuase the device is wired in a way which makes this possible. Is there any way openCL is able to use this capability of FPGAs?  Thank you for any help in advance! "

167,How to fix error on TeamCity with SoC EDS 18.1: Toolchain required to build project is not registered: Altera Baremetal GCC (with eclipse console executable: eclipsec.exe),"Note: This problem was also posted on an old thread that does no longer get attention.  We use an application called TeamCity for continuous integration. When developers check-in their changes, TeamCity will rebuild the software on an agent (that runs on a virtual machine with Windows Server 2016). I installed the following software on a TeamCity agent:  By default the TeamCity service runs with the SYSTEM account. I already detected some problems with Altera tooling and the SYSTEM account and decided to create a separate local account ""svc_teamcity"". I added this account to the administrators group and granted it permission to logon as a service (SeServiceLogonRight). I used this account to install the software (Nios II EDS and SoC EDS).  Next step is to configure the ""Altera Baremetal GCC"". First I did this manually with add_toolchain.exe and ds5_link.exe based on the info on:  As this did not help I decided to create a script that could be run as a post-install by TeamCity. In this way it would run in the same environment as a software build.  This is the script: This scripts runs successful on TeamCity, see output: When I run a software build configuration with the console executer of Eclipse (eclipsec.exe) I get the following error: How can this be solved?

171,How close is Intel is developing software development tools for embedded ARM processors that are as easy to use?,"Hello, I have a question but would like to give a brief introduction. My co-worker and I were discussing a new hardware design that would be an upgrade to an existing board. We decided on a DSP processor and the FPGA. We started talking about the design and said we could do things a lot faster if we put the software that is supposed to run on the DSP processor put it on the FPGA with embedded ARM cores. Everything done on a single device, how great it is. But, then we started talking about the complexities of programming the embedded ARM cores. We know of another co-worker that is using a Cyclone FPGA with embedded ARM cores and how long it has taken him to learn the tools and his comments on the development tools. We started talking that if a company could develop a suit to tools that would make it possible for the Hardware Designer to hand-off the board to the Software Development folks or End user and the tools would be so simple that they could compile their C/C++ code, debug their code in-ciruit, and program the code into the device all without bugging the Hardware Designer, wow! That would be the ultimate! Here's my question, has Intel reached that point in their tools for FPGA's with embedded ARM cores? "
